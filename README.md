# Archilllect Load
Download a picture from http://archillect.com/.
Every time you start it, a different picture is loaded.

You can start it with python2 by extecuting 
```
python archillect.py
```
The file will be downloaded to `img/archillect.NUMBER.jpg` by default, 
where NUMBER is the number of the archillect picture.
A symlink to the new file is created as `archillect.jpg`.

Look into the code, it's not that much. There are some configurations that can be adapted.
